<h1>Mayo Clinic </h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My work at Mayo Clinic focuses on delivering clinical impact with AI-assisted CT image processing. Specific problems faced by CT imaging are: 1) Image processing on the raw data often yields better results. The raw data, however, is not always available. Reconstruction domain algorithms are therefore more likely to be successfully deployed into clinical practice. 2) Although larger datasets often mean better generalizability, a pre-trained model on large datasets may not yield optimal results for a specific case of CT reconstruction, as various conditions (imaging protocols, patient conditions, reconstruction kernels, etc.) may cause deviations from the training data distribution. This affects the performance of the pre-trained CNN. 

Through the use of finetuning on patient-specific data from pre-trained models on large data, we aim to achieve improved results with efficiency.

<h2>Schematic outlining the self-supervised CT denoising framework. The upper panel depicts the first phase where a weakly-supervised training scheme is used to optimize a CNN classifier to sort CT image patches into uniform and non-uniform classes. The lower panel depicts the second phase, where the uniform patches were normalized and superimposed on the non-uniform patches to construct a dataset for optimizing a CNN-based denoising autoencoder. </h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">In this research, we address the critical issue of noise in CT imaging. Traditional methods for CT image denoising are hindered by the lack of suitable paired data for the supervised training of deep-learning models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a self-supervised learning approach that utilizes unlabeled clinical images. Our method employs a two-phase data extraction and model optimization pipeline, leveraging regions of uniform signal intensity to characterize local noise properties. We tested this framework on both a private Mayo Clinic dataset and the public TCIA Pancreas-CT dataset, demonstrating a remarkable 87% noise reduction in low-dose CT images while maintaining anatomical details. Furthermore, our method outperformed conventional denoising models in quantitative comparisons, highlighting its potential as a robust and versatile tool for enhancing CT image quality.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In this study, we tackle the challenge of metal-induced artifacts in CT images during interventional oncology procedures, which can hinder accurate probe placement and compromise the visibility of tissues. Our method involves a comprehensive framework for simulating and reducing metal artifacts caused by cryoablation probes. We validate this framework using a dataset comprising various probe configurations and apply it to real patient CT images. A blinded review by experienced radiologists demonstrates a significant improvement in multiple aspects of image quality, including iceball conspicuity and overall metal artifact reduction, affirming the effectiveness of our algorithm. This innovative image-based approach has the potential to enhance the precision and success of CT-guided interventional oncology procedures.</p>
