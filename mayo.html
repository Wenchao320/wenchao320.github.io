<h1>Mayo Clinic </h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My work at Mayo Clinic focuses on delivering clinical impact with AI-assisted CT image processing. Specific problems faced by CT imaging are: 1) Image processing on the raw data often yields better results. The raw data, however, is not always available. Reconstruction domain algorithms are therefore more likely to be successfully deployed into clinical practice. 2) Although larger datasets often means better generalizability, pre-trained model on large datasets may not yield optimal results for a specific case of CT reconstruction, as various conditions (imaging protocols, patient conditions, reconstruction kernels etc.) may cause deviations from the training data distribution. This affects the performance of the pre-trained CNN. 

Through the use of finetuning on patient-specific data from pre-trained models on large data, we aim to achieve improved results with efficiency.

<p style="text-align: left;">This project aims at infusing a novel CT image acquisition technique with the rapid advances in deep learning to revolutionize spectral CT. 
Despite considerable investigations on spectral CT, its clinical applications are impeded by the requirement of dedicated hardware. We investigated an alternative solution. It is inspired by fast kVp switching, but uses a much slow kVp switching rate so it can be implemented on conventional CT systems (single spectrum, energy integrating detector). This leads to several challenges in image processing. First, data is sparsely sampled in each energy level. Second, performing the material decomposition in the sinogram domain is not directly possible as the projection images of different energy levels are not angularly aligned. These challenges were overcome by deep learning. Multiple well-known (U-Net CNN, Pix2Pix GAN) and original neural network architectures were employed to perform sparse sinogram completion and material decomposition. </p>
