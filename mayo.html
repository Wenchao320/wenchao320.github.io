<h1>Mayo Clinic </h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My work at Mayo Clinic focuses on delivering clinical impact with AI-assisted CT image processing. Specific problems faced by CT imaging are: 1) Image processing on the raw data often yields better results. The raw data, however, is not always available. Reconstruction domain algorithms are therefore more likely to be successfully deployed into clinical practice. 2) Although larger datasets often mean better generalizability, a pre-trained model on large datasets may not yield optimal results for a specific case of CT reconstruction, as various conditions (imaging protocols, patient conditions, reconstruction kernels, etc.) may cause deviations from the training data distribution. This affects the performance of the pre-trained CNN. 

Through the use of finetuning on patient-specific data from pre-trained models on large data, we aim to achieve improved results with efficiency.

<p style="text-align: left;">We have previously trained a denoising CNN using a diverse range of reconstruction images. Our preliminary results indicate that the denoising CNN did not generalize well between FBP reconstruction kernels, but is insensitive to dose levels. The goal of this project is to develop a generalizable patient-specific image domain CT denoising method. The hypothesis is a limited number of noise patches from the patient reconstruction is sufficient for generating noise maps to fine-tune the pre-trained CNN to denoise the specific patient. Specifically, we aim to investigate using a limited number of noise patches to apply to the patient reconstruction, so the CNN learns to denoise in a "bootstrapping" manner. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This project aims at first, collecting a diverse range of metal implants and simulating metal artifact induced images in order to train a neural network for image domain metal artifact reduction; second, finetuning the pre-trained neural network on a specific patient. For the metal artifact simulation, forward projection of the clinical image together with the metal implant with accurate spectral and material information is crucial to the precise estimation of the detector signal of the metal regions. However, the original signal in the non-metal regions is still preferable over the simulation as it encourages the neural network to learn from the true signal with the original image and noise patterns. Therefore, we designed a dual-stream simulation pipeline to enable accurate metal artifact simulation while preserving the original clinical signal at the same time.
